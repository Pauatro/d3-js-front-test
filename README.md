This is a test using d3 and raw js for the generation of combined charts.

#Getting Started

Most important commands/instructions:

1. Download the Dependencies

```npm install```

2. See the Charts

You can just open the index.html using the browser to see the charts.

3. Test

```npm test```

I decided to include only snapshot tests as there is no data processing and no state management, leaving only the visual components to be tested. 

4. Build

```npm run-script build```
