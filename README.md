This is a test using d3 and raw js for the generation of combined charts.

#Getting Started

Follow the next steps to get the project up and running:

1. Download the Dependencies

```npm install```

2. Run the Tests

```npm test```

I decided to include only snapshot tests as there is no data processing and no state management, leaving only the visual components to be tested. 

3. See the Charts

You can just open the index.html using the browser to see the charts.
